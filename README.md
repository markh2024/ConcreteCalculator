![](app.png?raw=true)




### Objectives 

Beats trying to work it all  out by hand  every time   and gives you a print out  in PDF  format    , quote all  done for materials or you can save this to  CSV delimited file format  that you can then import back into a database to  log what you have done  on a particular job 


I sat  down this afternoon thinking how the hell  can I make this easier and  came up with this 

This might interest any other builders that  need to lay concrete  and need to work out costs  , materials  etc


That should  make your lives a  dam site easier
Pre requisites   Open JDK version 17  must be installed for this to run   but it will run or should in windows  and Linux platforms 


All code contain within  plus other required jar files 
Compiled using Net beans 
Enjoy
